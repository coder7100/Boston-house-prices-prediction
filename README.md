In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.
linear regression is useful for continous data/

## In this project we have used the following libraries:
  - scikit learn
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - ipython
  
## scikit-learn:
      
scikit learn is one of the most famous library in python for machine learning. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms. it also contains various datasets.
 
the dataset which we have used is also imported from this library

## matplotlib :

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy

## NumPy :

NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

## pandas

In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
